Simple bit of python to remotely view and manipulate the screen on an android device via ADB.  It was originally designed to work on google glass, but should work on any other android device with a working ADB connection

Uses PySimpleGUI for the interface and uses ADB to interface with the Android device.

Currently works with mouse clicks.  The screenshot updates on click events so right-click will update the screen.
